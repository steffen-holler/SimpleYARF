SimpleYARF or Simple Yet Another Roleplay Framework 

This project requries Visual Studio 2015 and the .NET 4.5 framework to run.


This is ment to be a simple and easy to use framework for converting a bitmap, 
any 8, 16, 24 or 32 bit bitmap (or any rastered image) into a full runable 
play map (dungeon).

Project Log:
6 Feburary 2017: this is in it's early pre-alpha stages. I plan on 
streaming these on Twitch and maybe YouTube in the near future. 

23 March 2017: Added Database table creation query for Simple YARF using mySQL
With these, I plan on adding more later. These tables allow for a mix and 
match of worlds, characters and rulesets for players games. I am also looking 
into using Mono or another cross platform .NET Standard language to allow 
Simple YARF to be more excessable to those with Linux, macOS, phones & tablets.
